    <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color= "white"> whats needed for a successful project? </font> </h2>
    <p><font color="white">
        Various methods, skills and resources are needed to complete a digital project successfully.Through organisation, software, the right knowledge and the right mindset, we can ensure a project is time efficient and a tested success. First of all, the secret behind any successful project is organisation and clear communication. The resources used to streamline this are slack and trello. In trello we can neatly and clearly break down sections of a project into individual tasks, we can outline the details of the task, assign a team member to a task, colour code tasks and ultimately file them into "To Do", "Doing" and "Done". This is perfect for any project to keep a clear head and see exactly how much of the project is done/still to do and is essential in time management. It allows everyone to be working on a project and know exactly what they are doing and their role in the project. For communication Slack is a useful resource for communicating in channels with other devs. In addition, Slack can be linked with Trello so that you can pin your board and individual task cards to the channel. This makes it even easier to reference sections of the project when communicating with other team members, cards can be pinned and the best way to approach it can be discussed all together in a Slack channel.
        </p>
    <p>For the main coding side of a project there are multiple methods, skills and resources available to complete the project. It is ultimately up to the team themselves to come to a democratic decision on what language and software would be the best for the team as a whole and what suits the needs of the project/employer. For our blog the resource we used was Visual Studio Code,and the skills we needed was basic html knowledge for inserting all the meat of the website. This was then mixed with CSS to format the blog and make it more presentable. The skills and mindset needed for a successful project are all described by Michael Lowe in his blog on Wrike “Collaborative, Strong communication skills, Problem solver, Attention to detail, Strong organizational skills, Ability to multitask and prioritize, Goal- and results-driven, Get things done, Manage cross-functional teams, Coordinate and facilitate meetings and reviews, Simplify complex workflows, Tech-savv, Data-driven”</p>

    <h2> <font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> IT in modern buisnesses </font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">IT continues to be the beating heart of a good operation. No matter the size of your business, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will make money and produce the results modern customers demand.  Most time consuming data tasks can now be automated and monitored by IT teams boosting efficiency and overall job satisfaction. IT can also have effects on the communication, cash flow, security of confidential information and trade advantages of a business.</p>
    <p>First of all, Communication with customers/employees becomes easier. In todays environment, it is necessary for employees to interact with clients quickly and clearly. Websites allow customers to find answers to their questions 24/7. Employees at different locations have better interactions. If factory managers can communicate with shipment coordinators at a different location, tensions and distrust are less likely to evolve. Cliques and social tensions can become a nightmare for a business; Fast shipment options allow businesses to move products over a large geographic area. Technology also helps a business understand its cash flow needs and preserve precious resources such as time and physical space. For example, warehouse inventory technologies let business owners understand how best to manage the storage costs of holding a product. With proper technology in place, executives can save time and money by holding meetings over the Internet instead of at corporate headquarters.  
        </p>
    <p>A main advantage for growing businesses is if you have the technological capacity to research new opportunities you will stay a step ahead of your competition. “For a business to survive, it must grow and acquire new opportunities.” The Internet allows a business to virtually travel into new markets without the cost of an executive jet or the risks of creating a factory abroad. This new found accessibility also leads to security risks. </p>
    <p>Most businesses of the modern era are subject to security threats and vandalism. Technology can be used to protect financial data, confidential executive decisions and other proprietary information that leads to competitive advantages. Simply put, technology helps businesses keep their ideas away from their competition. By having computers with passwords, a business can ensure none of its forthcoming projects will be copied by the competition. Evidently IT is the beating heart of a business, sure a business could potentially run without IT BUT with technology involved it improves every aspect of the business, and just like the heart it speeds up these process’ and gets the blood flowing through the business, communication, cash flow, security and efficiency.

    <h2> <font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> Risks that might impact digital projects </font></h2>
    <p>There are many risks that need to be addressed and evaluated related to completing a project successfully. There are always things that can hinder the overall efficiency and productivity of a project, and risks that can even damage the finished product of your project.</p>
    <p>First of all, many risks surrounding co-operation can seriously damage the time efficiency of completing a project on time. Miscommunication between group members is a key risk, whether that is due to the inefficient use of slack or ineffective co-operation, all team members need to know what jobs need working on and what their specific roles are within the project to be able to work efficiently on their own. Disputes between group members can pose a risk to a project, whether that dispute is personal, if someone has personal/social clashes, or whether that's professional disputes over things such as designs and graphical vision. All these time consuming risks can also involve poor scheduling/planning and deadline runovers as well.</p>
    <p>Other associated risks that might impact digital projects are inefficient testing or bugged code. It is close to impossible to avoid every single bug whilst creating a project and admittedly most of the fun is the puzzle solving that comes with particularly hard to spot problems, but overly sloppy code and not very detailed testing can lead to future problems with deployment and accessibility for the target audience. Also, a slightly buggy program doesn't send a very professional image to the employer or user. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, finances/budgets need to be carefully monitored and organised during a project. We have to be careful we don't run over-budget that could lead to client dissatisfaction and further problems with finishing the project. This also leads on to meeting specifications if you are doing a project for a client. Client specifications for what they want for their project are important as this should be the basis of the whole project, it's all good having a working project but if it doesn't coincide with the vision and overall look the client wanted this will still lead to project mishaps and even re-designing and eventual time constraints and runovers. </p>

    <h2> <font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> How do you
        select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
    <p> <font face="verdana"> Selecting the right kind of systems and software for a project is a very individual task. It all depends on your/your clients needs, the kind of project, the target audience, time framing and deployment. </p>
    <p>The beginning to any good project requires thought on how to perfectly execute the project and what technologies to use, “Everytime I start a new project for a client, the first problem to solve is to choose the right technology for the project. Let’s take a mobile application for example. We can use native SDK in Android and iOS to build two different applications, with different codebases. Another option is to use one of the many JavaScript framework out there like React Native or Ionic.” Francesco Strazzullo, Medium. Evidently, finding the “best” technology for the task is extremely important, but what defines “best”, and how would you go about selecting and using IT systems and software. “Often developers choose to write native applications without worrying about the real business need of the client. A native app built in the wrong context is just like a Ferrari in the desert, your client probably just needs a camel! :)” Francesco Strazzullo, Medium. </p>
    <p>Evidently there are several things to consider when selecting appropriate IT systems and software for a project, but one of the first things in mind must be the business needs of the client. In other words to choose a technology you need to know “why” your client needs the project, and not only “what” that project has to do, “Take a startup for example, its primary objective it’s to hit the market as fast as it can. So, the best choice could be an Ionic application: one codebase with an easy-to-learn framework in order to keep your velocity high enough.” These issues can be addressed by holding team meetings  before the project outlining the business’ background, audience and needs. This can be easily categorized into quality, scope, deadline and budget. “Meetings help me to fully understand what is the purpose of the project, what it should actually do, and also how to do it. In this way I’m confident about choosing the best technology for the job.” </p>
    <p>So, in nutshell, to effectively select IT systems and software, just ask the right questions to your client. “ choosing a technology, like most of the problems in software development, is all about people!” </p>

    <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> What is GDPR and its effects? </h2>
    <p><font face="verdana">GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation, and was put in place by the EU in may 2018. The Regulations affect the way all business’ hold and process data. Technology has vastly changed the way we communicate online and with this comes all the personal information we store on sites, from banking information to general contact details. Previously, business’ would state this is to offer more targeted and relevant communications for better customer service, however the GDPR aims to regulate how business’ use and process this data to be as transparent and safe with customers as possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “In a study of more than 800 IT and business professionals that are responsible for data privacy at companies with European customers, Dell and Dimension Research found that 80% of businesses know few details or nothing about GDPR. Recently, TrustArc found that only 20% of businesses believe they are now GDPR complaint. The worst part? More than 1 in 4 companies (27%) have yet to begin work on making their organization GDPR compliant – several months after the May 25th deadline has passed!” Jennifer Lund, Super Office. As you can see we have some work to do to fully implement GDPR but its aims are from a good place. What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe. But how does this directly relate to business’’ and day to day operations?
        
        </p>
    <p>Basically, GDPR applies to all businesses and organizations established in the EU, regardless of whether the data processing takes place in the EU or not. Even non-EU established organizations will be subject to GDPR. If your business offers goods and/ or services to citizens in the EU, then it’s subject to GDPR. All organizations and companies that work with personal data should appoint a data protection officer or data controller who is in charge of GDPR compliance. There are tough penalties for those companies and organizations who don’t comply with GDPR fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. GDPR gives these pretty self explanatory protections to customers, consent has to be given, the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to data portability, the right to be informed, the right to have information corrected, the right to restrict processing, the right to object, and finally, the right to be notified. All these new regulations gives customers control over their own personal information. 
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore, in order for businesses to uphold these new rules several changes are happening within businesses. These main changes are outlined in Jennifer Lunds, Super Office blog, “The conditions for obtaining consent are stricter under GDPR requirements as the individual must have the right to withdraw consent at any time and there is a presumption that consent will not be valid unless separate consents are obtained for different processing activities. This means you have to be able to prove that the individual agreed to a certain action, to receive a newsletter for instance. It is not allowed to assume or add a disclaimer, and providing an opt-out option is not enough. GDPR has changed a lot of things for companies such as the way your sales teams prospector the way that marketing activities are managed. Companies have had to review business processes, applications and forms to be compliant with double opt-in rules and email marketing best practices. In order to sign up for communication, prospects will have to fill out a form or tick a box and then confirm it was their actions in a further email. Organizations must prove that consent was given in a case where an individual objects to receiving the communication. This means that any data held, must have an audit trail that is time stamped and reporting information that details what the contact opted into and how. If you purchase marketing lists, you are still responsible for getting the proper consent information, even if a vendor or outsourced partner was responsible for gathering the data. In the B2B world, sales people meet potential customers at a trade show, they exchange business cards, and when they come back to the office, they add the contacts to the company’s mailing list. In 2018, this is not possible anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>Evidently GDPR is changing the way businesses run. Businesses main changes are mapping company data, analysing what data needs to be kept, putting security measures in place for existing data, reviewing documentation and establishing new procedures for handling personal data. “Data is a valuable currency in this new world, and while GDPR does create challenges and pain for us as businesses, it also creates opportunity. Companies who show they value an individual’s privacy (beyond mere legal compliance), who are transparent about how the data is used, who design and implement new and improved ways of managing customer data throughout its life cycle build deeper trust and retain more loyal customers.”

    <h2><font face="verdana">  How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control? <font color="white"></h2>
    <p>Trello was extremely useful for me especially for this blog. In a team I have outlined that you can mark “To Do”, “Doing”, and “Done” to clearly track progress. But Trello is just as useful on your own as well, personally i changed the lists to categories that i wanted to focus on rather than a time frame. This helped me to visualise all the components of my blog, both on the content side and the technical side. I still implemented a time frame by using colour codes for what stage a task was on, e.g doing done and to do. This helped me keep track of tasks whilst also being able to clearly identify all the components of my blog.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, Git and GitHub can help with our codes version control. “Version control software allows you to track the changes you make to your code, as well as being able to easily backtrack these changes, share your development efforts and more. Even if you are not contributing to Evennia itself, and only wish to develop your own MU* using Evennia, having a version control system in place is a good idea (and standard coding practice). For an introduction to the concept, start with the Wikipedia article here. Evennia uses the version control system Gitand this is what will be covered henceforth. Note that this page also deals with commands for Linux operating systems, and the steps below may vary for other systems, however where possible links will be provided for alternative instructions.” ‘Version Control, GitHub’

    <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white">  Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
    <p> There are several modern constraints including copyright laws that affect websites today, but knowing exactly what they mean and what that means for a website isn't always clear, through some research we can define what these constraints entail and there knock on effects. First of all, copyright,  "Copyright protection is automatic for any creative work that is created after 1978 and fixed in some tangible form. You don't have to display a copyright symbol or register rights to your item for it to receive copyright protection. For this reason, you should assume all content on the Web is copyrighted unless it explicitly states otherwise. Copyright laws are federal laws, which means you generally have to sue in federal court if someone violates your copyrights. If someone from another country steals your items -- an increasingly common phenomenon given the worldwide reach of the Internet -- it can be extremely difficult to enforce your copyright protection." Van Thompson, Small Business. 
        </p>
    <p>In addition, it is important to factor in fair use. " The ‘Fair Use Doctrine’ provides an exception to copyright laws for scholarly and educational purposes. Fair use permits people to take limited excerpts of works for articles, critiques and other public services. Parodies of copyrighted works are also generally protected. There is no standard excerpt that is permissible under law, and guidelines about fair use are relatively unspecific. If your small business has had copyrighted material copied from your website, courts examine the purpose of the use of copyrighted work, the financial effect the use has on the copyright holder, the degree to which an item was excerpted and the nature of the copyrighted work when determining whether a violation has occurred. For example, a person cannot excerpt a photo, so re-posting a photo from your website might constitute copyright infringement, but excerpting a line from a book you sale might not."

        <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white">  Describe the content and layout for each page  </h2>
            <p><b> First </b></p>
            <p>My first page is the welcome page to my blog, this is a basic page with minimal writing and attractive GUI to draw people in without overloading with information all on one page.
            </p>
            <p> <b>Second </b></p>
            <p>My second page is my personal page, again not the largest page but its content addresses personal questions. This page is uniformly laid out just like page 1, with a h1 Header, followed by a divide, an image, then each sub question laid out as h2 and related paragraphs. I find this layout visually pleasing and clean so this is what I stuck with for my blog. 
            </p>
            <p> <b>Third </b></p>
            <p>My third page is my IT knowledge page, much like page 2 it answers all set questions in a universal format. with a h1 Header, followed by a divide, an image, then each sub question laid out as h2 and related paragraphs. I find this layout easier to read when all the text is centralised as well. It breaks up large bulks of text along with div to section it out clearly and make it look more attractive and readable.

            <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white">  Issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them
                </h2>
        <p>There are many issues that can be addressed and improved when it comes to people with disabilities accessing and using web pages. By making a webpage more accessible to everyone you can increase your audience and make a more inclusive environment, sending a more professional and inclusive message to users. There are several ways access issues might affect the following people, blind people, partially blind people, colour blind people, dyslexic people and people speaking other languages. All these disabilities make it harder to read and access information from a web page, however the following is ways we can address these access issues. 
            </p>
        <p>
                Text to speak can be used to read the context of a webpage to a blind person and help bridge gaps to make the web page more accessible. Even enlarged text can help with partially-blind people. Other features to add include colour alteration for colour-blind people for easier reading and added colours to help with dyslexia, and make the page more readable for an inclusive audience.  Other ways we can make a web page more accessible is by adding language options as well. This can help people from other countries and languages access and understand your web page in their own way. 
                </p>
