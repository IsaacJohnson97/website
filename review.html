     <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white">In making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
    </h2>
       <p>For my website I mainly used Visual Studio Code,Trello and Git, for both the implementation and organisation of my website. Both IT tools were very useful to me but obviously each had individual drawbacks I adapted to and changed to ensure the website would run as smoothly as possible. First of all, the use of VSC was very useful and I am very happy with the overall performance. It was very user friendly and not too hard to grasp for beginners, command lines were simple and easy to remember and most issues came from personal formatting issues that I was able to spot and change. There was a wealth of resources and help online if I had any queries about html or css and how to implement features that I wanted for my website. At first I had most of my code in html but once I learned how to link a css file I formatted my website to add features into the css file and make it much easier to organise and read. Overall I am very happy with VSC. 
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore I used trello to organise my website, admittedly I did not use trello for the beginning of my website but as I had more and more tasks to keep track of it worked very well for me to organise my workload. At first, I believed it wasn't very useful to me but this changed as my workflow expanded and I realised how useful trello could be even on your own. Finally I used Git to log my changes to my website. At first, this was relatively tricky to get to grips with all the appropriate commands but once I had “Git add” “Git status” and “Git commit” several times, it became a lot easier. Git was very useful for everyone who needs to access and see the progress of my website, at the end of the day I can clearly see my logged changes and how my website has progressed that day. Overall, i am very happy with Git.

        <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
       </h2>
       <p>VSC, Trello and Git as previously mentioned were all used periodically throughout my website creation and all helped me in various ways. To answer the set question as plainly as possible, these IT tools were extremely appropriate as each tool had an essential role to play. VSC actually brought y website to life with a mixture of html and CSS. Trello helped me clearly organise and plan out stages of my website development. Finally, Git provided me with a repository where all my changes and additions were logged and easily accessible for later viewing. Overall, all of my IT tools were extremely appropriate and ultimately all were close to perfect in helping me to achieve my goal.

        <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
       </h2>
       <p>Overall, i’d say i am very happy with my website, but no project comes without criticism and something can always be improved. For my first website I thought I performed well with my very limited experience. The strengths of my website in my own opinion is the Graphical User Interface. I believe I did the appropriate extra research into making my website as presentable as possible. Even though it is at a relatively low level, even taking the extra time to research how to have an image as a background instead of a block colour really helped the overall professional look of my website, and being able to complete the project on time meant I had some spare time to do extra research into very basic animation, which I used to animate a ship on my welcome page. I tried to keep the look immersive but not cluttered, so i designed nice clean buttons that matched the style of the website but also helped me break up and connect my website into pages. This leads me onto the another strength of the website and that's cleanly represented data. All my questions answered and extra “meat” that needed to go into the website is very nicely set out and separated into pages and sub sections. At first I had some issues connecting these pages but after trial and error I got it working and with about 4 changes of the button style I finally came to a look that I thought worked well for my website and clearly separated all the data for people to be able to access and read easily.

    </p>
    <p>However, there are always drawbacks and everyone can think of improvements or weakness’ in retrospect after the completion of their project. First of all, I’d say one weakness of my project was the organisation. If i was to properly implement trello from the beginning then I believe next time this can be avoided. It wasn't until I had a million tasks to keep track of that I realised how useful Trello was, this useful learning curve will serve me well in the future though. In addition, a weakness of my website is the accessibility, if i wanted to make this website more professional i would be adding accessible features for disabled users as previously explored in a question. Also, even though I think I kept my website pretty clean, the gifs implemented might not be to the taste of everyone, and a weakness of the project could be seen as distracting images, however I am pretty confident it still remains clean and readable in most aspects.  

    </p>
    <p>In conclusion, Id say my website has stronger strengths than weakness’ however It would be stupid to believe the website is free from weakness and even I could improve it if I were to start the website again. However, overall I am very proud of my first website and look forward to access the strengths and weakness’ of many more to come.

            to your project
            
       </h2>
       <p>As previously touched upon their are several further improvements I could make to my website, like accessibility to users that was previously mentioned. Furthermore, ideally to improve the website you could add social media links for a more open experience and nice GUI layout. Finally, another further improvement could be more research into buttons, the main improvement id like to see in my website is drop down buttons, so each page had sub category buttons leading to each sections answer, making navigation through the site much easier and faster. With the addition of a search bar that could easily search exact content to display.

        <h2><font face="verdana"> <font color="white"> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose      
       </h2>
       <p>The outcomes of our website match the requirements very well. The requirements of our website is holding and displaying coursework information that we wrote in a working website, using both css and html. Effectively, I wanted to achieve this as cleanly as possible whilst disguising my inexperience by doing extra research into making my website attractive so you actually wanted to read it, whilst researching buttons to effectively navigate through my website to access the data as easily as possible. Researching buttons helped me to harness the use of both css and html and how they both complement each other. </p>
       <p>Overall, the outcomes of my website match the requirements very well and cleanly represent every aspect of the website. </p>
